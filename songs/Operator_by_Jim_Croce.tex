		\[G]Ope\[Bm]rator oh could you \[C]help me place this \[G]call
		\[Am]You see the number on the \[D]matchbook is old and \[Em]faded \[D] \[C] \[A] \[G]
		\[G] She's living in L.\[Bm]A with my \[C]best old ex-friend  \[G]Ray
		\[Am]A guy she said she \[D7]knew well and sometimes \[Em]hated \[D] \[C] \[A] \[G]

		\[G]Isn't that the \[C]way they say it \[G]goes
		But lets for\[C]get all \[D]that
		And \[G]give me the number if
		\[Am]you can find it
		So \[C]I \[D]can \[Em]call just to
		\[Bm]tell her I'm fine and to \[Am]show
		\[D]I've overcome the \[C]blow
		I've learned to take it \[G]well
		I only wish my \[Am]words could just convince my\[C]self
		That it just wasn't \[D7]real,
		but \[C]that's not the way if fe\[G]els

		\[G]Ope\[Bm]rator oh could you \[C]help me place this \[G]call
		\[Am]Cause I can't read \[D7]the number that you just gave \[Em]me \[D] \[C] \[A] \[G]
		\[G]There's something in my \[Bm]eye, you know it \[C]happens every \[G]time
		\[Am]I think about the \[D7]love that I thought would save \[Em]me \[D] \[C] \[A] \[G]

		\[G]Ope\[Bm]rator let's for\[C]get about this \[G]call
		\[Am]There's no one there \[D7]I really wanted to talk \[Em]to \[D] \[C] \[A] \[G]
		\[G]Thank you for your \[Bm]time,
		\[Bm]Cause you've been \[C]so much more than \[G]kind
		\[Am]You can keep the \[D7]dime
